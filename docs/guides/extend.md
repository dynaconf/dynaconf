# Extending

## Creating new loaders

In your project i.e called `myprogram` create your custom loader.

`myprogram/my_custom_loader.py`

```python
def load(obj, env=None, silent=True, key=None, filename=None):
    """
    Reads and loads in to "obj" a single key or all keys from source
    :param obj: the settings instance
    :param env: settings current env (upper case) default='DEVELOPMENT'
    :param silent: if errors should raise
    :param key: if defined load a single key, else load all from `env`
    :param filename: Custom filename to load (useful for tests)
    :return: None
    """
    # Load data from your custom data source (file, database, memory etc)
    # use `obj.set(key, value)` or `obj.update(dict)` to load data
    # use `obj.find_file('filename.ext')` to find the file in search tree
    # Return nothing
```

In the `.env` file or exporting the envvar define:

```bash
LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF=['myprogram.my_custom_loader', 'dynaconf.loaders.env_loader']
```

Dynaconf will import your `myprogram.my_custom_loader.load` and call it.

> **IMPORTANT**: the `'dynaconf.loaders.env_loader'` must be the last in the loaders list
> if you want to keep the behavior of having envvars to override parameters.

In case you need to disable all external loaders and rely only the `settings.*` file loaders define:

```bash
LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF=false
```

In case you need to disable all core loaders and rely only on external loaders:

```bash
CORE_LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF='[]'  # a toml empty list
```
