### Common Workflow


#### Prepare your environment

```bash
# clone your fork of this repo
git clone git@github.com:{$USER}/dynaconf.git

# Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dynaconf/dynaconf.git

# Activate your Python Environment
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dynaconf for development
make all

```

#### Work on a task

```bash
# Checkout to a working branch
git checkout -b my_feature

# Open your favorite editor (VSCode for example)
code .

# After editing please rebase with upstream. Fix any conflicts if any.
git fetch upstream; git rebase upstream/master

# Update docs/guides/ if needed

# Edit tests_functional/ if needed

# Create a new app in tests_functional/{your_example}

# Run your test in isolation for quick iterations
tests_functional/runtests.py --filter {your_example}

# Then ensure everything is ok
make all
```

#### Submit your PR

```bash
# Now commit your changes
git commit -am "Changed XPTO to fix #issue_number"

# Push to your own fork
git push -u origin HEAD

# Open github.com/dynaconf/dynaconf and send a Pull Request.
```

### Run integration tests

* `make all` do not run integration tests for Redis and Vault.
* If you want to run integration tests, make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose`
installed.

```bash

# To install docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
<output truncated>

# To permit your user run docker commands without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker {$USER}

# Run complete integration tests
make test_integration

# or Run functional example tests individually
make test_redis
make test_vault
```
