# Flask Extension

Dynaconf provides a drop in replacement for `app.config`.

As Flask encourages the composition by overriding the `config_class` attribute this extension follows the [patterns of Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/subclassing/) and turns your Flask's `app.config` in to a `dynaconf` instance.

## Initialize the extension

Initialize the **FlaskDynaconf** extension in your `app`

```python
from flask import Flask
from dynaconf import FlaskDynaconf

app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskDynaconf(app)
```

> You can optionally use `init_app` as well.

## Use `FLASK_` environment variables

Then the `app.config` will work as a `dynaconf.settings` instance and `FLASK_` will be the global prefix for exporting environment variables.

Example:

```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=true              # app.config.DEBUG
export FLASK_INTVALUE=1              # app.config['INTVALUE']
export FLASK_MAIL_SERVER='host.com'  # app.config.get('MAIL_SERVER')
```

## Settings files

You can also have settings files for your Flask app, in the root directory (the same where you execute `flask run`) put your `settings.toml` and `.secrets.toml` files and then define your environments `[default]`, `[development]` and `[production]`.

To switch the working environment the `FLASK_ENV` variable can be used, so `FLASK_ENV=development` to work
in development mode or `FLASK_ENV=production` to switch to production.

> **IMPORTANT**: To use `$ dynaconf` CLI the `FLASK_APP` must be defined.

IF you don't want to manually create your config files take a look at the [CLI](/cli/)


## Loading Flask Extensions Dynamically

You can tell Dynaconf to load your Flask Extensions dynamically as long as the extensions follows the Pattens of Flask extensions.

The only requirement is that the extension must be a `callable` that accepts `app` as first argument. e.g: `flask_admin:Admin` or `custom_extension.module:init_app` and of course the extension must be in Python namespace to be imported.

For extensions initialized just use the class or function path like: "flask_admin:Admin" or "extension.module:init_app"

having a `settings.toml`

```toml
[default]
EXTENSIONS = [
  "flask_admin:Admin",
  "flask_bootstrap:Bootstrap",
  "custom_extension.module:init_app"
]
```

Considering an `app.py` like:

```py
from flask import Flask
from dynaconf import FlaskDynaconf

app = Flask(__name__)
flask_dynaconf = FlaskDynaconf(app)

app.config.load_extensions()
```

Optionally you can pass `load_extensions(key="OTHER_NAME")` pointing to your list of extensions.

It is also possible to use environment variables to set the extensions to be loaded.

```bash
# .env
export FLASK_EXTENSIONS="['flask_admin:Admin']"
```

The extensions will be loaded in order.


### Develoment extensions

It is also possible to have extensions that loads only in development environment.

```toml
[default]
EXTENSIONS = [
  "flask_admin:Admin",
  "flask_bootstrap:Bootstrap",
  "custom_extension.module:init_app"
]

[development]
EXTENSIONS = [
  "dynaconf_merge",
  "flask_debugtoolbar:DebugToolbar"
]
```
