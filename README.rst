    **dynaconf** - The **dyna**\ mic **conf**\ igurator for your Python
    Project

|MIT License| |PyPI| |PyPI| |Travis CI| |Coverage Status| |Codacy grade|

**dynaconf** is an OSM (**O**\ bject **S**\ ettings **M**\ apper) it can
read settings variables from a set of different data stores such as
**python settings files**, **environment variables**, **redis**,
**memcached**, **ini files**, **json files**, **yaml files** and you can
customize **dynaconf** loaders to read from wherever you want. (maybe
you really want to read from xml files ughh?)

Why?
====

    Store config in the environment

    An appâ€™s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys
    (staging, production, developer environments, etc). This includes:

    Resource handles to the database, Memcached, and other backing
    services Credentials to external services such as Amazon S3 or
    Twitter Per-deploy values such as the canonical hostname for the
    deploy Apps sometimes store config as constants in the code. This is
    a violation of twelve-factor, which requires strict separation of
    config > from code. Config varies substantially across deploys, code
    does not.

    A litmus test for whether an app has all config correctly factored
    out of the code is whether the codebase could be made open source at
    > any moment, without compromising any credentials.

how does it work
================

In any place of your project you only need to

.. code:: python

    from dynaconf import settings

    # Connecting to a database
    conn = MyDB.connect(username=settings.USERNAME, password=settings.PASSWORD)

    # Defaults?
    servername = settings.get('SERVERNAME', 'http://mydefaultserver.com')

    # namespaces and environment?
    with settings.using_namespace('development'):
        ...
        
    # Type casting?
    $ export DYNACONF_VALUE='@float 66.6'
    # or 
    settings.as_float('VALUE')

    # And more!!! Try it.

Q: Where those settings values comes from?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: Your choice! environment variables, settings file, yaml file, toml file, ini file, json file, redis server, database, anywhere you want.

Install
=======

.. code:: bash

    pip install dynaconf

    NOTE: this project officially supports and encourages only Python
    3+. Currently this is working well and tests are passing on any
    Python version above 2.7 but at any moment we can drop python2.x
    support if needed.

define your settings module
===========================

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_SETTINGS=myproject.settings
    or
    export DYNACONF_SETTINGS=myproject.production_settings
    or
    export DYNACONF_SETTINGS=/etc/myprogram/settings.py

    HINT: The ``DYNACONF_SETTINGS`` can be ``.py`` or ``.yml`` (Support
    for json, ini, toml is coming, please contribute.)

    NOTE: If you do not define DYNACONF\_SETTINGS so the default will be
    ``settings.py`` on the root directory

you can export extra values
===========================

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_DATABASE='mysql://....'
    export DYNACONF_SYSTEM_USER='admin'
    export DYNACONF_FOO='bar'

Or define all your settings as env\_vars starting with **DYNACONF\_**

    HINT: You can change ``DYNACONF_NAMESPACE`` to any name e.g
    ``MYPROJECT`` and then environment vars prefixed with ``MYPROJECT_``
    will be loaded.

Example
=======

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_SETTINGS=myproject.settings
    export DYNACONF_FOO='bar'
    export DYANCONF_NUMBER='@int 1234'  # force casting as int when reading

file: myproject/settings.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    NAME = 'Bruno'

file:app.py
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python


    from dynaconf import settings

    print settings.NAME
    print settings.DATABASE
    print settings.SYSTEM_USER
    print settings.get('FOO')
    print settings.NUMBER

then
~~~~

.. code:: bash

    python app.py

    Bruno
    mysql://..
    admin
    bar
    1234

Namespace support
=================

When you are working with multiple projects using the same environment
maybe you want to use different namespaces for ENV vars based configs

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_DATABASE="DYNADB"
    export PROJ1_DATABASE="PROJ1DB"
    export PROJ2_DATABASE="PROJ2DB"

and then access them

.. code:: python

    from dynaconf import settings

    # configure() or configure('settingsmodule.path') is needed
    # only when DYNACONF_SETINGS is not defined
    settings.configure()

    # access default namespace settings
    settings.DATABASE
    'DYNADB'

    # switch namespaces
    settings.namespace('PROJ1')
    settings.DATABASE
    'PROJ1DB'

    settings.namespace('PROJ2')
    settings.DATABASE
    'PROJ2DB'

    # return to default, call it without args
    settings.namespace()
    settings.DATABASE
    'DYNADB'

You can also use the context manager:

.. code:: python

    settings.DATABASE
    'DYNADB'

    with settings.using_namespace('PROJ1'):
        settings.DATABASE
        'PROJ1DB'

    with settings.using_namespace('PROJ2'):
        settings.DATABASE
        'PROJ2DB'

    settings.DATABASE
    'DYNADB'

    namespace() and using\_namespace() takes optional argument **clean**
    defaults to True. If you want to keep the pre-loaded values when
    switching namespaces set it to False.

Namespaced environment
----------------------

It is usual to have e.g ``production`` and ``development`` environments,
the way to set this is:

Using ``settings.py`` as base file you just need other ``<environment>_settings.py`` files.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    settings.py
    development_settings.py
    production_settings.py

Then in your environment.

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_NAMESPACE=DEVELOPMENT|PRODUCTION  # switch enviroment using env vars.

Or using ``namespace``

.. code:: python


    with settings.using_namespace('development'):
        # code here

    settings.namespace('development')

    NOTE: ``settings.py`` is the base and ``namespace`` specific
    overrides its vars.

using YAML
~~~~~~~~~~

Using YAML is easier because it support multiple namespace in one file.

Lets say you have ``DYNACONF_NAMESPACE=DYNACONF`` (the default)

.. code:: yaml

    DYNACONF:  # this is the global namespace
      VARIABLE: 'this variable is available on every namespace'
      HOST: null  # this variable is set to None

    DEVELOPMENT:
      HOST: devserver.com  # overrides the global or sets new

    production:  # upper or lower case does not matter
      host: prodserver.com

Then it will be applied using env var ``DYNACONF_NAMESPACE`` or context
manager.

    HINT: When using yaml namespace identifier and first level vars are
    case insensitive, dynaconf will always have them read as upper case.

casting values from envvars
===========================

Sometimes you need to set some values as specific types, boolean,
integer, float or lists and dicts.

built in casts

-  @int (as\_int)
-  @bool (as\_bool)
-  @float (as\_float)
-  @json (as\_json)

    @json / as\_json will use json to load a Python object from string,
    it is useful to get lists and dictionaries. The return is always a
    Python object.

strings does not need converters.

You have 2 ways to use the casts.

Casting on declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just start your ENV settigs with this

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_DEFAULT_THEME='material'
    export DYNACONF_DEBUG='@bool True'
    export DYNACONF_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_ENABLED='@bool False'
    export DYNACONF_PAGINATION_PER_PAGE='@int 20'
    export DYNACONF_MONGODB_SETTINGS='@json {"DB": "quokka_db"}'
    export DYNACONF_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS='@json ["jpg", "png"]'

Starting the settings values with @ will make dynaconf.settings to cast
it in the time od load.

Casting on access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_USE_SSH='yes'

    from dynaconf import settings

.. code:: python


    use_ssh = settings.get('USE_SSH', cast='@bool')
    # or
    use_ssh = settings('USE_SSH', cast='@bool')
    # or
    use_ssh = settings.as_bool('USE_SSH')

    print use_ssh

    True

more examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_USE_SSH='enabled'

    export DYNACONF_ALIST='@json [1,2,3]'
    export DYNACONF_ADICT='@json {"name": "Bruno"}'
    export DYNACONF_AINT='@int 42'
    export DYNACONF_ABOOL='@bool on'
    export DYNACONF_AFLOAT='@float 42.5'

.. code:: python


    from dynaconf import settings

    # original value
    settings('USE_SSH')
    'enabled'

    # cast as bool
    settings('USE_SSH', cast='@bool')
    True

    # also cast as bool
    settings.as_bool('USE_SSH')
    True

    # cast defined in declaration '@bool on'
    settings.ABOOL
    True

    # cast defined in declaration '@json {"name": "Bruno"}'
    settings.ADICT
    {u'name': u'Bruno'}

    # cast defined in declaration '@json [1,2,3]'
    settings.ALIST
    [1, 2, 3]

    # cast defined in decalration '@float 42.5'
    settings.AFLOAT
    42.5

    # cast defined in declaration '@int 42'
    settings.AINT
    42

Defining default namespace
==========================

Include in the file defined in DYNACONF\_SETTINGS the desired namespace

.. code:: python

    DYNACONF_NAMESPACE = 'DYNACONF'

Storing settings in databases
=============================

Using REDIS
-----------

Redis support relies on the following two settings that you can setup in
the DYNACONF\_SETTINGS file

1 Add the configuration for redis client

.. code:: python

    REDIS_FOR_DYNACONF = {
        'host': 'localhost',
        'port': 6379,
        'db': 0
    }

    NOTE: if running on Python 3 include ``'decode_responses': True`` in
    ``REDIS_FOR_DYNACONF``

Include **redis\_loader** in dynaconf LOADERS\_FOR\_DYNACONF

    the order is the precedence

.. code:: python


    # Loaders to read namespace based vars from diferent data stores
    LOADERS_FOR_DYNACONF = [
        'dynaconf.loaders.env_loader',
        'dynaconf.loaders.redis_loader'
    ]

You can now write variables direct in to a redis hash named
``DYNACONF_< NAMESPACE >``

By default **DYNACONF\_DYNACONF**

You can also use the redis writer

.. code:: python

    from dynaconf.utils import redis_writer
    from dynaconf import settings

    redis_writer.write(settings, name='Bruno', database='localhost', PORT=1234)

The above data will be converted to namespaced values and recorded in
redis as a hash:

::

    DYNACONF_DYNACONF:
        NAME='Bruno'
        DATABASE='localhost'
        PORT='@int 1234'

    if you want to skip type casting, write as string intead of
    PORT=1234 use PORT='1234' as redis stores everything as string
    anyway

Data is read from redis and another loaders only once or when
namespace() and using\_namespace() are invoked. You can access the fresh
value using **settings.get\_fresh(key)**

There is also the **fresh** context manager

.. code:: python

    from dynaconf import settings

    print settings.FOO  # this data was loaded once on import

    with settings.fresh():
        print settings.FOO  # this data is being directly read from loaders

And you can also force some variables to be **fresh** setting in your
setting file

.. code:: python

    DYNACONF_ALWAYS_FRESH_VARS = ['MYSQL_HOST']

or using env vars

.. code:: bash

    export DYNACONF_ALWAYS_FRESH_VARS='@json ["MYSQL_HOST"]'

Then

.. code:: python

    from dynaconf import settings

    print settings.FOO  # This data was loaded once on import

    print settings.MYSQL_HOST # This data is being read from redis imediatelly!

Using programatically
=====================

Sometimes you want to override settings for your existing Package or
Framework lets say you have a **conf** module exposing a **settings**
object and used to do:

``from myprogram.conf import settings``

Now you want to use Dynaconf, open that ``conf.py`` or
``conf/__init__.py`` and do:

.. code:: python

    # coding: utf-8
    from dynaconf import LazySettings

    settings = LazySettings(
        ENVVAR_FOR_DYNACONF="MYPROGRAM_SETTINGS_MODULE",
        DYNACONF_NAMESPACE='MYPROGRAM'
    )

Now you can import settings from your own program and dynaconf will do
the rest!

Flask Extension
===============

Dynaconf provides an extension to make your ``app.config`` in Flask to
be a ``dynaconf`` instance.

.. code:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from dynaconf.contrib import FlaskDynaconf

    app = Flask(__name__)
    FlaskDynaconf(
        app,
        ENVVAR_FOR_DYNACONF="MYSITE_SETTINGS_MODULE",
        DYNACONF_NAMESPACE='MYSITE',
        SETTINGS_MODULE_FOR_DYNACONF='settings.yml',  # or settings.py, .toml, .ini etc....
        YAML='.secrets.yml',  # aditional config where you store sensitive data our of vcs
        EXTRA_VALUE='You can add aditional config vars here'
    )

Take a look at ``examples/flask`` for more.

    This was inspired by flask.config and django.conf.settings
