  - fix integer key access
  - Changes on inspect
      - History now saves the raw value instead of parsed, as parsed will be showed on the current_value anyway
      - Set will always create a source_metadata even if not passed or if a str is passed as laoder_identifier
      - Internal uses of set are now tracked
      - dynaconf_hooks.py is now tracked
      - set method now keeps `value` as the raw unparsed value and `parsed` as the evaluated value
      - `inspect` command no more prints `django app detected`
      - get_history now accepts `include_internal` to output internal identifiers
      - `_get_data_by_key` refactored for dotted path traversal
      - access to integer indexes on dotted path removed, we gonna implement later as `key._1_`
      - Fixed the acceptance of keys with other types

- HOTFIX: Add coverage for 2 lines on validators. [Bruno Rocha]
- Add the ability for selective validation (#549) [Bruno Rocha, Jacob
  Callahan]

  This change introduces the ability to control which sections of a
  settings object are subject to validation.
  This is controlled primarily by two mechanisms.
  1: When creating a settings object, new arguments `validate_only`
     and `validate_exclude` have been added which receive a list of settings
     paths.
  2: When manually calling validate, new arguments `only` and `exclude`
     have been added.
  All of these allow for either a string or list of strings representing
  settings paths. For example:
      `settings.validators.validate(only=["settings.something",
      "settings.another"])`

      settings = Dynaconf(..., validate_exclude="settings.bad")

- Refactor Vault integration (#202) [Pavel Alimpiev]

  * Add AppRole based authorization for Vault loader

  * Fix default value for VAULT_PATH_FOR_DYNACONF, Update docs

  * HVAC automatically adds /secret/ prefix on read and write access
  * /dynaconf was never added to the VAULT_PATH_FOR_DYNACONF value
  * Docs was inconsistent with the actual code base

  * Fix inconsistency in the docs

  * Remove VAULT_SESSION_FOR_DYNACONF config variable.

  * HVAC's session argument must be a fully initialized Session object,
  that means - it's very complicated to setup Vault client with this
  argument, via default instruments (.toml, .env, etc)
  * Users can still setup this argument by setting up VAULT_FOR_DYNACONF
  directly

  * Update documentation for VAULT_* configuration

  * Fix code style

  [Bruno Rocha]

  If your settings has existing variables of types `list` ot `dict` and you want to `merge` instead of `override` then
  the `dynaconf_merge` and `dynaconf_merge_unique` stanzas can mark that variable as a candidate for merging.

  For **dict** value:

  Your main settings file (e.g `settings.toml`) has an existing `DATABASE` dict setting on `[default]` env.

  Now you want to contribute to the same `DATABASE` key by addind new keys, so you can use `dynaconf_merge` at the end of your dict:

  In specific `[envs]`

  ```toml
  [default]
  database = {host="server.com", user="default"}

  [development]
  database = {user="dev_user", dynaconf_merge=true}

  [production]
  database = {user="prod_user", dynaconf_merge=true}
  ```

  In an environment variable:

  ```bash
  export DYNACONF_DATABASE='{password=1234, dynaconf_merge=true}'
  ```

  Or in an additional file (e.g `settings.yaml, .secrets.yaml, etc`):

  ```yaml
  default:
    database:
      password: 1234
      dynaconf_merge: true
  ```

  The `dynaconf_merge` token will mark that object to be merged with existing values (of course `dynaconf_merge` key will not be added to the final settings it is jsut a mark)

  The end result will be on `[development]` env:

  ```python
  settings.DATABASE == {'host': 'server.com', 'user': 'dev_user', 'password': 1234}
  ```

  The same can be applied to **lists**:

  `settings.toml`
  ```toml
  [default]
  plugins = ["core"]

  [development]
  plugins = ["debug_toolbar", "dynaconf_merge"]
  ```

  And in environment variable

  ```bash
  export DYNACONF_PLUGINS='["ci_plugin", "dynaconf_merge"]'
  ```

  Then the end result on `[development]` is:

  ```python
  settings.PLUGINS == ["ci_plugin", "debug_toolbar", "core"]
  ```

  The `dynaconf_merge_unique` is the token for when you want to avoid duplications in a list.

  Example:

  ```toml
  [default]
  scripts = ['install.sh', 'deploy.sh']

  [development]
  scripts = ['dev.sh', 'test.sh', 'deploy.sh', 'dynaconf_merge_unique']
  ```

  ```bash
  export DYNACONF_SCRIPTS='["deploy.sh", "run.sh", "dynaconf_merge_unique"]'
  ```

  The end result for `[development]` will be:

  ```python
  settings.SCRIPTS == ['install.sh', 'dev.sh', 'test.sh', 'deploy.sh', 'run.sh']
  ```

  > Note that `deploy.sh` is set 3 times but it is not repeated in the final settings.

  The **dynaconf_merge** functionality works only for the first level keys, it will not merge subdicts or nested lists (yet).
- Set up CI with Azure Pipelines (#142) [Bruno Rocha]

  - setup azure pipelines ci
  - remove travis
  - fix windows support
- Add dynaconf_include examples. [Bruno Rocha]
- Fix #110 add docs for dynaconf_include. [Bruno Rocha]

  fix #110
- Fix #117 add support for extra secrets file (like for jenkins CI)
  [Bruno Rocha]

  Now it is possible to export SECRETS_FOR_DYNACONF and have this
  extra point loaded, like in a Jenkins CI you can specify on job.

  ```yaml
  secret_file:
    variable: SECRETS_FOR_DYNACONF
    credentials:
      type: specific_credentials
      value: /path/to/secrets_file.toml{json,ini,yaml,py}

  ```

  That variable can also be a list of paths.

- Fix exponential slow down when loader is run multiple times. [Pete
  Savage]

  * When using context managers, the loader is invoked each time.
    This was slowing down in an exponential manner each time the it was run.
    The eventual cause of this was down to an attribute being used as a list.
    The object merge dutifully tried to expand this item out again and again
    even in the case that the list was a single item, resulting in [item],
    becoming [item, item]. The next time the merge was run, this process was
    run again, but for each item in the list. In this particular instance
    the list was identical, it meant that the list grew exponentially.
  * This fix is a short optimization that checks to see if the old list
    is identical to the new list. In which case, there is no merge to complete
    so we simply return.

  can be used for multiple environments. [Raoul Snyman]

- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:rochacbruno/dynaconf. [Bruno
  Rocha]

  Left this accidentaly.

  https://travis-ci.org/rochacbruno/dynaconf/jobs/452612532
- Add INSTANCE_FOR_DYNACONF and --instance. [Mantas]

  There parameters allows dynaconf to use different LazySettings instance
  if project uses one.

  Also did some other fixes along the way:

  - Added `catch_exceptions=False` to `CliRunner.invoke` in order to
    prevent click from swallowing errors silently. This uncovered other
    errors in init and validate cli commands.

  - Removed module level code execution from cli module. Module level code
    execution makes it really difficult to test code. Now cli does not
    rely on global state and can be tested properly.

  - Removed a code snipper from LazySettings which modified global
    default_settings values. This means, that each LazySettings
    constructor call has side effects.

  - `dynaconf validate` command tests were useless because they didn't
    test anything and I found, that `dynaconf validate` command don't even
    work and raises ValidationError if there are any validation errors.
    Changed that to cli friendly error message.
- Merge branch 'jperras-merge-multiple-settings-files' [Bruno Rocha]
- Remove extraneous lines. [Joel Perras]
- Handle nested includes in settings files. [Joel Perras]

  A settings file can include a `dynaconf_include` stanza, whose exact
  syntax will depend on the type of settings file (json, yaml, toml, etc)
  being used:

  ```toml
  [default]
  dynaconf_include = ["/absolute/path/to/plugin1.toml", "relative/path/to/plugin2.toml"]
  DEBUG = false
  SERVER = "www.example.com"
  ```

  When loaded, the files located at the (relative or absolute) paths in
  the `dynaconf_include` key will be parsed, in order, and override any
  base settings that may exist in your current configuration.

  The paths can be relative to the base `settings.(toml|yaml|json|ini|py)`
  file, or can be absolute paths.

  The idea here is that plugins or extensions for whatever framework or
  architecture you are using can provide their own configuration values
  when necessary.

  It is also possible to specify glob-based patterns:

  ```toml
  [default]
  dynaconf_include = ["configurations/*.toml"]
  DEBUG = false
  SERVER = "www.example.com"
  ```

  Currently, only a single level of includes is permitted to keep things
  simple and straightforward.
- Allow dotted-path based setting of configuration key/value pairs.
  [Joel Perras]

  You can set a value with an arbitrary number of nested keys, separated
  by dots:

  ```python
  settings.set('nested_1.nested_2.nested_3.nested_4', 'secret')
  ```

  And accessing the keys/values with dotted-path lookup behaves as
  expected:

  ```python
  print(settings.NESTED_1.NESTED_2.NESTED_3.to_dict())
  ```

  If for some reason you didn't want to have a key parsed into nested
  structures delimited by dots and just wanted a key of "foo.bar", you can
  disable the parsing with:

  ```python
  settings.set('nested_1.nested_2.nested_3.nested_4',
               'secret',
               dotted_lookup=False)
  ```

  And accessing keys that don't exist will raise `KeyError`:

  ```python
  settings.NESTED_1.NESTED_5
  ```


1.1.0 (2018-10-26)
------------------
- Released 1.1.0. [Bruno Rocha]

  - Added `MERGE_ENABLED_FOR_DYNACONF` with ability to merge nested dictionaries instead of replacing PR #88
  - Support for dot notation to access nested dictionaries like `settings['KEY.OTHER.NESTED.DEEPER']` PR #93
  - Support dotted notation for validators PR #98
  - Fixed a bug in SETTINGS_MODULE cleanup when `.setenv` method was called PR #97
  - Added Python 3.7 to test matrix PR #99
- Fixing new flake8 warnings. [Bruno Rocha]
- Update py.test command in tox to allow passing positional arguments.
  [Joel Perras]

  The basic, default functionality of running `tox` remains unchanged. You
  are now, however, able to pass positional arguments to `py.test` at
  invocation time. For example:

  ```bash
  tox -- -x --pdb tests/test_basic.py
  ```

  Which will pass all input after the `--` separator (which is used to
  signify the end of possible options to `tox`) down to the `py.test`
  command in the `{posargs}` location, as defined in `tox.ini`.
- Enable Python 3.7 env for tox testing. [Joel Perras]
- Enable python 3.7 in TravisCI config. [Joel Perras]
- Updates Missing singleton with __eq__ dunder. (#98) [Joël Perras]

  Adds some additional tests for the `Missing` class and singleton
  instance usage to ensure it returns equality only for comparisons to
  itself and not `None`, or `False`, or `True`.
- Merge branch 'jperras-dotted-validators' [Bruno Rocha]
- Updates Missing singleton with __eq__ dunder. [Joel Perras]

  Adds some additional tests for the `Missing` class and singleton
  instance usage to ensure it returns equality only for comparisons to
  itself and not `None`, or `False`, or `True`.
- Implements dotted-path validator name declarations. [Joel Perras]

  One is now able to write:

  ```python
  settings.validators.register(
      Validator('REDIS',  must_exist=True,  is_type_of=dict),
      Validator('REDIS.HOST', must_exist=True, is_type_of=str),
      Validator('REDIS.PORT', must_exist=True, is_type_of=int),
  )
  ```

  Which will validate the dotted attributes as nested structures. For
  example, in yaml:

  ```yaml
  DEFAULT:
      REDIS:
          HOST: localhost
          PORT: 1234
  ```

  This necessitated a slight but non-negligible change in the
  implementation of `Settings.exists()`, which previously did a shallow
  check of loaded data. It has now been updated to perform a
  `Settings.get()` of the key in question, and compares that to a newly
  defined sentinel value to ensure `None` values do not cause a false
  negative result.

  New tests and assertions have been added to cover the new functionality.
  Docs have been updated to show an example of the nested validator name
  definition in action.

  Closes rochacbruno/dynaconf#85.
- Fix #94 setenv cleans SETTINGS_MODULE attribute. [Bruno Rocha]
- Merge branch 'jperras-dot-traversal-access' [Bruno Rocha]
- Merge branch 'dot-traversal-access' of
  https://github.com/jperras/dynaconf into jperras-dot-traversal-access.
  [Bruno Rocha]
- Allow dot-traversal access to nested dictionaries. [Joel Perras]

  A simple memoized recursion has been added to `get()` if the key
  contains at least one dot.

  The caller can choose to opt-out of this behaviour by specifying the
  `dotted_lookup` argument:

  ```python
  settings('AUTH.USERNAME', dotted_lookup=False)
  ```

  While the performance impact of this has not been quantified, the net
  impact in any real-world application should be minimal due to typical
  nesting levels, and the fact that we overwrite the memoized portion of
  the dotted-key lookup on each iteration.

  - Can be opted-out on a per-call basis [✓]
