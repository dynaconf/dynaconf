[0, 15, 77]: 2018-11-09
  - setting `yaml.sort_base_mapping_type_on_output = False`, will prevent
    explicit sorting by keys in the base representer of mappings. Roundtrip
    already did not do this. Usage only makes real sense for Python 3.6+
    (feature request by `Sebastian Gerber <https://bitbucket.org/spacemanspiff2007/>`__).

  - reverted CommentedMap and CommentedSeq to subclass ordereddict resp. list,
    reimplemented merge maps so that both ``dict(**commented_map_instance)`` and JSON
    dumping works. This also allows checking with ``isinstance()`` on ``dict`` resp. ``list``.

  - support round-trip of tagged sequences: ``!Arg [a, {b: 1}]``
  - single entry mappings in flow sequences now written by default without quotes
    set ``yaml.brace_single_entry_mapping_in_flow_sequence=True`` to force

    ** The loading/dumping is still YAML 1.1 code**, so use the common subset of
    YAML 1.2 and 1.1 (reported by `Ge Yang <https://bitbucket.org/yangge/>`__)

[0, 15, 61]: 2018-08-23

[0, 15, 59]: 2018-08-17
  - issue with C based loader and leading zeros (reported by 
    `Tom Hamilton Stubber <https://bitbucket.org/TomHamiltonStubber/>`__)

[0, 15, 58]: 2018-08-17
  - simple mappings can now be used as keys when round-tripping::

      {a: 1, b: 2}: hello world
      
    although using the obvious operations (del, popitem) on the key will
    fail, you can mutilate it by going through its attributes. If you load the
    above YAML in `d`, then changing the value is cumbersome:

        d = {CommentedKeyMap([('a', 1), ('b', 2)]): "goodbye"}

    and changing the key even more so:

        d[CommentedKeyMap([('b', 1), ('a', 2)])] = d.pop(
                     CommentedKeyMap([('a', 1), ('b', 2)]))

    (you can use a `dict` instead of a list of tuples (or ordereddict), but that might result
    in a different order, of the keys of the key, in the output)
  - check integers to dump with 1.2 patterns instead of 1.1 (reported by 
    `Lele Gaifax <https://bitbucket.org/lele/>`__)

    pinpointed, by `Alex Grönholm <https://bitbucket.org/agronholm/>`__

[0, 15, 55]: 2018-08-14

  - unmade ``CommentedSeq`` a subclass of ``list``. It is now
    indirectly a subclass of the standard
    ``collections.abc.MutableSequence`` (without .abc if you are
    still on Python2.7). If you do ``isinstance(yaml.load('[1, 2]'),
    list)``) anywhere in your code replace ``list`` with
    ``MutableSequence``.  Directly, ``CommentedSeq`` is a subclass of
    the abstract baseclass ``ruamel.yaml.compat.MutableScliceableSequence``,
    with the result that *(extended) slicing is supported on 
    ``CommentedSeq``*.
    (reported by `Stuart Berg <https://bitbucket.org/stuarteberg/>`__)
  - duplicate keys (or their values) with non-ascii now correctly

(0.13.0) 2016-11-20:
  - if ``load()`` or ``load_all()`` is called with only a single argument
    (stream or string)
    a UnsafeLoaderWarning will be issued once. If appropriate you can surpress this
    warning by filtering it. Explicitly supplying the ``Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader``
    argument, will also prevent it from being issued. You should however consider
    using ``safe_load()``, ``safe_load_all()`` if your YAML input does not use tags.

    Several formatting parameters are preserved with some normalisation:
  - preserve 'T', 't' is replaced by 'T', multiple spaces between date
    and time reduced to one.
  - optional space before timezone is removed
  - still using microseconds, but now rounded (.1234567 -> .123457)
  - Z/-5/+01:00 preserved

(0.12.4) 2016-08-19:
  - Fix for issue 44: missing preserve_quotes keyword argument (reported
    by M. Crusoe)

(0.12.3) 2016-08-17:
  - correct 'in' operation for merged CommentedMaps in round-trip mode
    (implementation inspired by J.Ngo, but original not working for merges)
  - iteration over round-trip loaded mappings, that contain merges. Also
    keys(), items(), values() (Py3/Py2) and iterkeys(), iteritems(),
    itervalues(), viewkeys(), viewitems(), viewvalues() (Py2)
  - reuse of anchor name now generates warning, not an error. Round-tripping such
    anchors works correctly. This inherited PyYAML issue was brought to attention
    by G. Coddut (and was long standing https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=515634)
