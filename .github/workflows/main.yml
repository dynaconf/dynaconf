# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [master]
    paths-ignore: # run if anything different from these is modified
      - "docs/**"

  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

      - "docs/**"
      - "mkdocs.yml"

# When a Push is made on an existing branch/PR
# it cancels any pre running job and
